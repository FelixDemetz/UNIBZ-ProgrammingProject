## 1. About

Tower Defense game by Felix Demetz and Lucas Gl√ºck.

The project consists in creating a "tower defense" videogame. The goal is to have a gaming experience in which, the user through a proper GUI, must defend a certain road (= a direction in which an element moves) by the enemy (= an element that decrements a score, if reached certain coordinates). The game ends if there is no more enemy, (means that the Base survived), if the Bases health is 0 or less, or if the Money is less then 0. Once the game is finished, the player can register with a username the score in the local scoreboard (= a txt file). We use the "JavaFX" library to emulate and display the game. The user can interact with the mouse on 2D elements displayed on the screen.

## 3. Usage

How to compile, package and run the project.

1. Compile via Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn compile
   ```
2. Package via Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn package
   ```
3. Run via Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn javafx:run
   ```

## 4. Implementation

### 4.1. Architectural Overview

We decided to have classes for the 4 main elements of the game: Defender, Enemy, the Base and the App (running and displaying the game). Later on we added other important classes like Coordinate and Player.
We used JavaFX to create a simple but "easy to handle" GUI.

### 4.2. Third-Party Libraries

None

### 4.3. Programming Techniques

List and explain how you used the 10 programming techniques required for this project.

- **Technique 1**: We used Collections (ArrayList, arrays) to gather many elements of the same type
- **Technique 2**: We used Custom exceptions to get informed when a file (the scoreboard.txt file) is not present or corrupt.
- **Technique 3**: We use Try-Catch blocks to read and write on a file and to throw exceptions
- **Technique 4**: We used met overriding in the Launcher.java start() met and in our custom exception class.
- **Technique 5**: We used met overriding in our custom exception class.
- **Technique 6**: We used lambda expressions to handle events mainly on buttons (setOnAction())
- **Technique 7**: We used Optionals in every Alert dialog pane, to use ButtonTypes.
- **Technique 8**: We used I/O when reading or writing on our Scoreboard.txt.
- **Technique 9**: We used regular expressions to filter certain parts of the scoreboard and then set up the best player.
- **Technique 10**: We used the graphical interface JavaFX so that the user can more easily interact with the game.
- **Technique 11** We used varargs to add a different number of elements (Coordinates) in to an Constructor.

### 4.4. Tests

We often tried to test the game just by running it, but in some cases the the test classes helped us: to write cleaner code, find bugs and and remove unnecessary data.

Test Classes:

- BaseTest: tests the mode (Survival or Normal) and that the case that it could not read the file.

- EnemyTest: tests, the instantiation of Enemies, if the Enemie has passed the EndingPoint and the Coordinates.

- DefenderTest: tests the coordinates and the damage of the Defender.

- PlayerTest: tests the best Player out of a Array of them.

- CoordinateTest: testet Setters, Getters and the String met.

## 5. Experience

### 5.1. Overall Experience

The implementation of a tiny story in the game, made the hours of "googleing" and the problems with JavaFX easier to handle. We noticed that sometimes one member spend hours on the implementation of a new method and just did minor progesses, and then out of nowhere the other member figured it out in some minutes. We underestimated the time needed to research and to find the right classes and techniques to implement certain behaviors.
To know that we only used the knowledge that we gained during lectures, the internet, and our motivation to start form an idea in our head and than see the game working as we sketched it, fills us with joy.

### 5.2. Division of Responsibilities

- **Student Felix Demetz** I designed the game on paper, created the GUI, wrote stupid little descriptions.
- **Student Lucas Gl√ºck** Got the idea to create a TD game, to create something on which we spend hour on gaming. I was in charge to test the game.

The design of the main classes was teamjob as we both worked in the same room.
We never clearely divided responsabilities, we developed the game together, writing lines of code whenever we came up with new features and ideas.

### 5.3. Main Challenges

- **Student Felix Demetz** The most difficult part was to implement a class or a method that runs a loop evey X seconds without pressing a button (initially we added a button to move the Enemies forward but it wasn't optimal). It is difficult to search something online when you don't know what you are looking for. At the end we came up with the Timeline class (not Timer, not Time).
- **Student Lucas Gl√ºck** For me one big challange was to set up the framework in which the game is working on. You know that a program is launched with a main met, but then to add a GUI with panes in it wasn't easy.

A big challenge (for both of us) was to design the entire project, where to put a method, which classes we need, ecc. At the end we decided to have an App class (most important one) and a Base class that saves Health, Money, GameMode and so on.

### 5.4. Learning Outcomes

Describe what you learned with this project.

- **Student Felix Demetz** learned about:
   - I/O library, how to read and write from files.
   - Shape library, how to manage Rectangles, Circles and Lines.
   - Animation library, to time the main game loop with an timeline.
   - Control.Alert library, how to work wiht alert Panes.
   - The ButtonType type for alert panes.
   - To use Regex to split up text parts.
   - To change "window / pane" when the app pauses, finishes or ends game.
   - To use Maven on a project.
   - To create test classes for our project.
   - To create a GUI using JavaFX.

- **Student Lucas Gl√ºck** learned about:
   - Shape library
   - Timeline, for the main game loop
   - JavaFX in general
   - Implementing maven
   - Writing JUnit5 tests
   - keeping it cool when something doesn't worküòÇ (joke)
